# Antazoey

Hello, Apes! It is I.
* I am one of the main devs for [ApeWorX](https://github.com/ApeWorX).
* I also made [Patchday](https://github.com/antazoey/patchday-ios) for iOS, an app for HRT.
* I support some other small Python packages, such as [audius-py](https://github.com/antazoey/audius-py).
* I also love to make music, games, and art.
